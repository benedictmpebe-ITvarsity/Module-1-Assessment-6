        <p><b>Design:</b> The iPhone X was Apple’s first premium smartphone that featured an 82.9% screen-to-body ratio. The new designed ditched the home button for an impressive face id recognition, embedded in what’s now called the notch. This is achieved by the 12MP 3D Depth Sensor, which uses AI with help of its powerful A11 Bionic Processor. The iPhone X is available in Silver and Space Grey with a stainless steel frame and glass rear back. </p>
        <p><b>Camera:</b> Part of the X’s new design is the new 12MP dual rear camera with Quad-LED dual-tone flash. The Quad LED flash means you can take lighter pictures in darker enviroment and it also comes with a nifty portrait mode feature for taking studio quality photos. </p>
        <p><b>Performance:</b> If Apple is not believed, the A11 processor, at its time of release, was the fastest chip ever in a smartphone. The A11 Bionic Processor uses machine learning to deliver better battery life, and produce better photos in all conditions. </p>
